  setEditingField(field);
};

const handleSaveProfile = async (updates: Record<string, any>) => {
  await updateProfile(updates);
  setEditingField(null);
  await refreshData();
};
```

#### **2. DashboardNavigation Bulletproofing**:

// Complete null safety
const userDisplayInfo = useMemo(() => {
  if (!userProfile) {
    return {
      initials: 'U',
      formattedMembership: 'Guest',
      canAccessHost: false
    };
  }
  
  const displayName = userProfile.displayName || 
    `${userProfile.firstName || ''} ${userProfile.lastName || ''}`.trim() || 
    'User';
  // ... safe processing
}, [userProfile]);
```

#### **3. DashboardBookings Array Safety**:
```typescript
// Comprehensive array validation
const filteredBookings = useMemo(() => {
  if (!bookings || !Array.isArray(bookings)) {
    return [];
  }
  
  switch (activeBookingTab) {
    case 'upcoming':
      return bookings.filter(b => b.status === 'confirmed' || b.status === 'pending');
    // ... safe filtering
  }
}, [bookings, activeBookingTab]);
```

#### **4. Helper Functions Defensive Programming**:
```typescript
// Enhanced parameter validation
export function formatMembershipType(membershipType: string | undefined | null): string {
  if (!membershipType) {
    return 'Guest';
  }
  
  switch (membershipType.toLowerCase()) {
    // ... safe processing
  }
}
```

#### **5. Enhanced Hook Architecture**:
```typescript
// Complete data state management
const [bookings, setBookings] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [favorites, setFavorites] = useState<any[]>([]);

return {
  user,
  bookings,    // Now properly provided
  favorites,   // Now properly provided
  loading,
  errors,
  refreshData,
  updateProfile
};
```
